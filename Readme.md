# PoetRNN

This project is a *Python* implementation of a LSTM recurrent neural network designed to learn and produce short verse poetry. Despite being written with poetry in mind it is likely flexible enough to learn and produce other types of data (In fact, if you think of something new and creative to do with it I would love to hear about it).
